**Introducing TAPS: A New Paradigm in Wallet Security, and Birb Wallet: Its Premier Implementation**

**The Challenge:** 
The existing wallet systems fall short in offering users the pinnacle of security. While the Three Address Protocol (TAP) is a step forward, it lacks a genuine cold vault, leaving many NFT enthusiasts vulnerable. (https://x.com/punk6529/status/1701623475725533524?s=20)

**The Solution:** 
I present the **TAPS (Tetrad Address Protocol with Social)**. This protocol introduces four distinct wallets:

1. **Minting Wallet:** For minting assets in trusted and untrusted websites.
2. **Transaction Wallet:** Exclusively for trusted marketplace interactions.
3. **Social Vault:** Only signs trusted contracts for social participation, such as delegate.cash.
4. **Cold Vault:** A true cold storage, ensuring maximum security.

TAPS goes beyond just defining "states" for where your digital assets should reside. It introduces the concept of "state transitions". At its core, TAPS operates on two primary flows: vaulting and unvaulting. Vaulting refers to the transition of digital assets from less secure states to more secure ones, while unvaulting is the opposite, moving assets from more secure states to those with lower security.

To bring the TAPS paradigm to life, I present the **Birb Wallet** - a tangible implementation of this protocol.

**Simplifying the User Experience:** 
Recognizing that not every web3 user is tech-savvy, I've encapsulated these four wallets into a singular "wallet account". This design ensures:

- **Streamlined Security and Flexibility:** Birb Walletâ€™s intuitive "action2goal" paradigm offers users the greatest flexibility possible without compromising security. With a single click, complex processes are simplified into straightforward, secure steps.

- **Elimination of Potential Points of Failure:** By segregating wallet functionalities, the risks associated with each wallet are diminished. For instance, if a trusted contract has a bug leading to the compromise of the social wallet, the cold vault remains unaffected. Similarly, a compromised minting wallet won't threaten funds in the cold vault. This design ensures that vulnerabilities or breaches in one area don't jeopardize the entire system.


**FAQs:**

- **Do I need to manually set up delegate.cash and other social-related contracts?** 
  Upon creating a wallet, you'll be guided through a streamlined setup process. I will design it to handle most contract interactions in-house, making them as automated as possible. Manual permissions will only be required in specific instances.

- **Is a hardware wallet necessary for both the social and cold wallets?** 
  During the wallet creation process, we'll strongly recommend using a hardware wallet for enhanced security. However, the choice remains yours.

- **How can I be sure you won't introduce a malicious contract?** 
 The entire codebase will be open-sourced, accompanied by comprehensive instructions on compiling and running the wallet independently. Furthermore, it will be available through trusted platforms like the Chrome extension store. This project isn't about building a company; it's about enhancing web3's security landscape.

- **Can I sign anything with my cold vault?** 
  No. While you can import the address to Metamask, it's counterproductive to our security goals.

- **What about the social vault?** 
  It's restricted to the delegate.cash contract and select social verification contracts.

- **What can I do with my transaction wallet?** 
  Interactions are limited to trusted marketplace contracts.

- **And the mint wallet?** 
  Here, you have full freedom. However, exercise caution.

- **What if my mint wallet is compromised?** 
  The birb wallet will guide you step by step to seamlessly transition to a new mint wallet, ensuring continued security.

**Open Source Commitment:** 
In the spirit of fostering a safer web3 environment for all, this solution will be open-sourced. While premium solutions like @safe exist, we believe in establishing a high baseline of security accessible to everyone.


**Visuals:**

Upon opening the wallet, you're instantly presented with a dropdown menu showcasing your "wallet accounts." Each account represents a set of four wallets. The interface prominently features the two primary actions: vaulting and unvaulting.




When you choose "vaulting," you're presented with the five essential combinations, streamlined for clarity and security:


On selecting "unvaulting," you'll see the three crucial options, eliminating unnecessary complexities:


When attempting to connect to a website, the system will internally route the assets to their designated locations. While you'll be prompted with clear permissions to approve throughout the process, on the user interface, you'll be presented with the following view:
